\usage{
get.mle(pos, replicates, dilutions, monte = 15000, conf.level = 0.95,
  iupm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pos}{Vector of number of positive wells at each dilution level (outcome of SLD Assay)}

\item{replicates}{Vector of number of replicates at each dilution level}

\item{dilutions}{Vector of number of cells per well at each dilution level}

\item{monte}{Number of Monte Carlo samples. Default is exact (no MC sampling), unless
more than 15,000 possible positive well outcomes exist, in which case 15,000 MC samples are taken.
 Use monte=F for exact computation.}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level of the interval.}

\item{iupm}{Boolean variable, indicates whether to return MLE as IUPM (TRUE) or probability a cell is infected (FALSE)}
}
\value{
\item{MLE}{Maximum likelihood estimate for the given outcome vector.}

\item{BC_MLE}{Bias corrected maximum likelihood estimate for the given outcome vector.}

\item{Exact_PGOF}{P value for goodness of fit. PGOF is the probability of an
experimental result as rare as or rarer than that obtained, assuming that the model is
correct. Low values of PGOF, (e.g. PGOF < 0.01), indicate rare or implausible experimental
results. Samples with a very low PGOF might be considered for retesting.}

\item{Asymp_PGOF}{P value calculated using an asymptotic Chi-Squared distribution with D-1 degrees of freedom,
where D is the number of dilution levels in an SLD assay.}

\item{Exact_CI}{Exact confidence interval, computed from the likelihood ratio test (recommended)}

\item{Asymp_CI}{Wald asymptotic confidence interval, based on the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.}

\description{
Calculates the maximum likelihood estimate of concentration of infectious units
from a single serial limiting dilution (SLD) assay. Also calculates corresponding
exact and asymptotic confidence intervals, and a goodness-of-fit p-value. While
this package was developed with the purpose of estimating IUPM, it is applicable to SLD
assays in general.
